![alt tag](/HitBoxImg.png)

To import to Intellij IDEA: <code>File->Open->hitbox.ipr</code>

This project was built using <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/" target="_blank">LibGDX framework</a> and Flow Field 
pathfinding algorithm. Used <a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/" target="_blank">Tiled Map Editor</a> to generate levels. The pattern for level's name is <code>###</code>, where <code>#</code> - digit from <code>[0, 9]</code>. Xbox controller support.
Mobile versions (Android, IOS) are still in development process, but you can test desktop version with or without controller. The project will change over time (fixing bugs, adding new features, etc.). Enjoy!
